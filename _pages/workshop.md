## Rationale


Binary population synthesis is a technique developed in the last two decades, which combines the latest results on stellar evolution with the power of state-of-the-art computational resources to predict the properties of large groups of binaries at any time in their evolution. The Workshop aims to bring together researchers working in binary population synthesis at Padova University with colleagues in Argentina interested in using these techniques. 

The main goal is to foster collaborations between groups, discussing possible joint programs to investigate high-mass stellar and binary populations and their effects on diverse systems in the Universe. A relaxed program with senior speakers in the area and plenty of time for discussion has been prepared.

## 1st. SEVN School on Binary Population Synthesis

</p>

SEVN (Stellar EVolution for N-body) is a recently developed, updated and public code to compute single and binary population synthesis. Most of the public population-synthesis codes rely on the same models for stellar evolution, which limits the capability to explore the differences and uncertainties that arise from stellar evolution theory. 

The School aims to enhance the skills of the students in population synthesis by learning to use SEVN. It consists in lectures providing the tools to run and analyze SEVN simulations and many hands-on sessions to work on a project chosen by the student.
