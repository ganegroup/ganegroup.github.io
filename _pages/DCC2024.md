First announcement: Deciphering the Cosmic Code for Galaxy Formation"

Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce the workshop "Deciphering the Cosmic Code for Galaxy Formation" in Puerto Varas, Chile, on 9-13 December 2024. 

The workshop will bring together observational and numerical researchers working on galaxy formation and evolution to discuss successes, problems and new perspectives to advance the understanding of how galaxies formed and evolved in different environments. The workshop will focus on the following topics:

Recycled gas and metals within galaxies and between galaxies and their environment.

SN, AGN and other possible sources of feedback, especially at high redshifts, and their role in regulating star formation activity over time.

Fossils of galaxy assembly: from stellar halos to intracluster light.

The evolution of stellar populations and galaxy morphologies over time and in different environments.

The invited speakers are V. Avila-Reese, L. Bignone, S. Bonolli (TBC), V. Bromm (TBC), S. Cheng, S. Ellison, F. Fragkoudi, G. , C. Frenk (TBC), R. Grand, G. Kauffmann, A. Monachesi, T. Naab, S. Pedrosa, V. Springel, and S.White.

We are aiming for no more than 80 participants in order to create a motivating and relaxed atmosphere that encourages discussion among participants, including students and senior researchers.

Registration and abstract submission will be open until 30 May 2024. All relevant information, including deadlines and registration process, can be found below

We look forward to seeing you in Puerto Varas!
