Dr. Susana Pedrosa

I am a researcher at the Institute for Astronomy and Space Physics, University of Buenos Aires/CONICET, specializing in the physics processes underlying the formation and evolution of galaxies. My primary approach involves numerical simulations. Presently, I co-lead the Numerical Astrophysics and Extragalactic Group. Additionally, I am an advocate for the role women in science and gender equality. I also derive great enjoyment from and place value on science popularization activities.

Dr. Leonardo Pelliza

Dr. Lucas Bignone
 
My name is Lucas Bignone. I am currently a CONICET researcher at the Instituto de Astronomía y Física del Espacio (IAFE) in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Our group focuses on using numerical simulations to study the formation and evolution of galaxies. I am also very interested in machine learning and deep learning techniques, specially applied to examining the morphologies of galaxies.

At the moment, I am working on several projects implementing supervised and unsupervised deep learning methods to study the shapes of galaxies and their morphological components.

Previously, I was a FONDECYT postdoctoral fellow at Andrés Bello University in Santiago de Chile, where I worked with Patricia Tissera on numerical simulations of galaxy formation.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Physics at the University of Buenos Aires in 2017 working with Patricia Tissera and Leonardo Pellizza on the properties of long gamma ray bursts and their host galaxies.

I obtained my Master’s degree in Physics at the University of Buenos Aires in 2011 working with Leonardo Pelliza and Andrés Piatti studying formation mechanisms of Milky Way open clusters.

In 2017, I taught a numerical astrophysics course for astronomy Master students at Andres Bello Univeristy. Until 2017, I also taught an introductory astronomy course for high school students at the astronomical observatory of the Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires.

Dr. Pedro Cataldi 

Pedro Cataldi joined the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics (IAFE) in early 2016 as an undergraduate student under the direction of Dr. Susana Pedrosa and Dr. Patricia Tissera. He works on galaxy formation and alternative cosmological models, in a numerical context. 

Long earned his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Buenos Aires in 2023, currently he is doing a postdoctoral research, where he mostly focused on analyzing the signs of galaxy assembly bias in LSST survery and in cosmological numerical simulations.

Lic. Lautaro Carvalho

Lautaro Carvalho joined the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics (IAFE) in 2023 as a Ph.D. student under the direction of Dr. Leonardo Pelliza. He's currently working on numerical simulations of the early Universe, analyzing the effects of Cosmic Rays on the Intergalactic Medium during the Cosmic Dawn and how they may have contributed to the reionization Universe.
