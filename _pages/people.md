Dr. Susana Pedrosa

I am a researcher at the Institute for Astronomy and Space Physics, University of Buenos Aires/CONICET, specializing in the physics processes underlying the formation and evolution of galaxies. My primary approach involves numerical simulations. Presently, I co-lead the Numerical Astrophysics and Extragalactic Group. Additionally, I am an advocate for the role women in science and gender equality. I also derive great enjoyment from and place value on science popularization activities.

Dr. Pedro Cataldi 

Pedro Cataldi joined the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics (IAFE) in early 2016 as an undergraduate student under the direction of Dr. Susana Pedrosa and Dr. Patricia Tissera. He works on galaxy formation and alternative cosmological models, in a numerical context. 

Long earned his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Buenos Aires in 2023, currently he is doing a postdoctoral research, where he mostly focused on analyzing the signs of galaxy assembly bias in LSST survery and in cosmological numerical simulations. 

## PhD Students:

Lic. Lautaro Carvalho

Lautaro Carvalho joined the Institute of Astronomy and Space Physics (IAFE) in 2023 as a Ph.D. student under the direction of Dr. Leonardo Pelliza. He's currently working on numerical simulations of the early Universe, analyzing the effects of Cosmic Rays on the Intergalactic Medium during the Cosmic Dawn and how they may have contributed to the reionization Universe.
