## Rationale

SEVN (Stellar EVolution for N-body) is a recently developed, updated and public code to compute single and binary population synthesis. Most of the public population-synthesis codes rely on the same models for stellar evolution, which limits the capability to explore the differences and uncertainties that arise from stellar evolution theory. SEVN overcomes this issue implementing a different paradigm by interpolating stellar evolutionary tracks pre-computed with hydrostatical codes like MESA or PARSEC, and using updated prescriptions for the processes undergoing in interacting binaries.


In particular, SEVN was used to study the formation channels of binary compact objects progenitors of gravitational waves, the chemically homogeneous stellar evolution, the impact of different prescriptions of common envelope and mass transfer on the orbital properties of the binaries, and many other aspects of binary evolution.


SEVN is fully written in C++, following the Object Oriented Paradigm. This allows to include the binary evolution as a library in other codes (e.g. in codes for cluster dynamics). In this way stellar evolution can be taken into account in simulations of different astrophysical contexts. Its modular implementation also allows the user to easily include new prescriptions to study other types of populations.


The School aims to enhance the skills of the students in population synthesis by learning to use SEVN. It consists in lectures providing the tools to run and analyze SEVN simulations and many hands-on sessions to work on a project chosen by the student.
