The understanding of the properties, formation and evolutionary channels of stellar systems comprising high-mass stars is currently at the forefront of Astrophysics. Massive stars are luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation that produce powerful massive outflows. At the end of their lives they explode as supernovae, injecting large amounts of energy into their surroundings. Those evolving in binary systems may became also luminous sources of high-energy radiation powered by accretion, and launch relativistic jets. The influence of high-mass stars in their medium is therefore strong, and occurs during their brief lifetimes, which modifies their neighborhood in a significant way.


Among other effects, these stars are responsible for the heating and ionization of the intergalactic medium at the Cosmic Dawn, the regulation of star formation in galaxies, and the chemical evolution of the Universe. High-mass stellar remnants (neutron stars, black holes) are also interesting in their own right because they may be used to test the physics on extreme conditions, such as very dense matter or intense gravitational fields. The investigation of the latter is particularly timely, given the new window to the Universe opened recently by gravitational-wave observatories.


Binary population synthesis is a technique developed in the last two decades, which combines the latest results on stellar evolution with the power of state-of-the-art computational resources to predict the properties of large groups of binaries at any time in their evolution. It allows therefore to explore the observable properties of these systems, compare to actual observations, validate evolutionary theories, and investigate how these binaries affect the systems in which they live.


The Workshop aims to bring together researchers working in binary population synthesis at Padova University with colleagues in Argentina interested in using these techniques. The main goal is to foster collaborations between groups, discussing possible joint programs to investigate high-mass stellar and binary populations and their effects on diverse systems in the Universe. A relaxed program with senior speakers in the area and plenty of time for discussion has been prepared.
